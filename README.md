### Hello, my name is Alex

Website: https://azaslavskis.github.io/azaslavskis/  

I’m a Graduate Electronics and Computer Engineering student aiming to grow in avionics and space technologies.  
My main focus is **embedded hardware and software design** — from custom PCBs to low-level firmware and tools that actually get used.

# Skills

1. **Electronics & PCB Design** – Designing custom boards in **KiCad** and **Altium Designer**, including Linux-capable boards. I enjoy taking a design from schematic to finished PCB and prototype.

2. **Embedded Systems & C** – Working with **STM32 / ESP32 / AVR** microcontrollers, bare-metal and register-level programming, and **Embedded Linux** using **Yocto** and **Buildroot**.

3. **Desktop & Tools Development** – Building utilities and tooling in **Rust** and **C# on Windows**, especially for tasks like working with large video files or controlling hardware.

4. **Python & Automation** – Writing Python scripts to automate everyday tasks, glue systems together, and speed up development workflows.

5. **3D Modeling & Fabrication** – Creating enclosures and mechanical parts in **Fusion 360** and **SolidWorks**, and turning them into real parts with **3D printing**. Comfortable with **SMD soldering down to 0402**.

6. **AI Integration** – Exploring how to use AI for deep learning (e.g. YOLO), automation, and smarter tooling around embedded systems and hardware design.
